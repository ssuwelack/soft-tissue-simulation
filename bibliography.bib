  Abstract                 = {{We present a set of methods to implement an implicit Finite Element solver on the GPU. In contrast to previous FEM implementations on the GPU which only address explicit time integration, our method allows large time steps for arbitrarily stiff objects. Unlike previous GPU-based sparse solvers, we avoid the assembly of the system matrix, and parallelize the matrix op- erations directly on the original object mesh. This considerably reduces the number of operations required, and more importantly the consumed band- width, enabling the method to be fast enough for highly complex interactive stiff body simulations. The presented methods can be applied in game and visual effects simulations, as well as medical and physics applications, where FEM is well established but currently limited by its computational cost. The core of the method can also be applied to many other scientific appli- cations where a large irregular sparse system of equations is solved using an iterative method.}},

  Abstract                 = {Minimally invasive medical procedures such as
biopsies, anesthesia drug injections, and brachytherapy cancer
treatments require inserting a needle to a specific target inside
soft tissues. This is difficult because needle insertion displaces
and deforms the surrounding soft tissues causing the target
to move during the procedure. To facilitate physician training
and preoperative planning for these procedures, we develop a
needle insertion motion planning system based on an interactive
simulation of needle insertion in deformable tissues and
numerical optimization to reduce placement error. We describe
a 2-D physically based, dynamic simulation of needle insertion
that uses a finite-element model of deformable soft tissues and
models needle cutting and frictional forces along the needle shaft.
The simulation offers guarantees on simulation stability for mesh
modifications and achieves interactive, real-time performance on
a standard PC. Using texture mapping, the simulation provides
visualization comparable to ultrasound images that the physician
would see during the procedure. We use the simulation as a
component of a sensorless planning algorithm that uses numerical
optimization to compute needle insertion offsets that compensate
for tissue deformations. We apply the method to radioactive seed
implantation during permanent seed prostate brachytherapy to
minimize seed placement error.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging MRSI have
been shown to be very useful for identifying prostate cancers. For high sensitivity, the MRI/MRSI
examination is often acquired with an endorectal probe that may cause a substantial deformation of
the prostate and surrounding soft tissues. Such a probe is removed prior to radiation therapy
treatment. To register diagnostic probe-in magnetic resonance MR images to therapeutic probeout
MR images for treatment planning, a new deformable image registration method is developed
based on biomechanical modeling of soft tissues and estimation of uncertain tissue parameters
using nonlinear optimization. Given two-dimensional 2-D segmented probe-in and probe-out
images, a finite element method FEM is used to estimate the deformation of the prostate and
surrounding tissues due to displacements and forces resulting from the endorectal probe. Since
FEM requires tissue stiffness properties and external force values as input, the method estimates
uncertain parameters using nonlinear local optimization. The registration method is evaluated using
images from five balloon and five rigid endorectal probe patient cases. It requires on average 37 s
of computation time on a 1.6 GHz Pentium-M PC. Comparing the prostate outline in deformed
probe-out images to corresponding probe-in images, the method obtains a mean Dice Similarity
Coefficient DSC of 97.5% for the balloon probe cases and 98.1% for the rigid probe cases. The
method improves significantly over previous methods P0.05 with greater improvement for
balloon probe cases with larger tissue deformations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an approach for fast subspace integration
of reduced-coordinate nonlinear deformable models that is suitable
for interactive applications in computer graphics and haptics. Our
approach exploits dimensional model reduction to build reducedcoordinate
deformable models for objects with complex geometry.
We exploit the fact that model reduction on large deformation
models with linear materials (as commonly used in graphics)
result in internal force models that are simply cubic polynomials
in reduced coordinates. Coefcients of these polynomials can be
precomputed, for efcient runtime evaluation. This allows simulation
of nonlinear dynamics using fast implicit Newmark subspace
integrators, with subspace integration costs independent of geometric
complexity. We present two useful approaches for generating
low-dimensional subspace bases: modal derivatives and an interactive
sketching technique. Mass-scaled principal component analysis
(mass-PCA) is suggested for dimensionality reduction. Finally,
several examples are given from computer animation to illustrate
high performance, including force-feedback haptic rendering of a
complicated object undergoing large deformations.},

addresses these issues by presenting algorithms that automatically
generate a high quality hexahedral finite-element mesh and automatically
calculate boundary conditions for an imaged patient.

image registration. Encouraging results are presented for the registration
of CT image pairs which exhibit deformation caused by
pressure from an endorectal imaging probe and deformation due

required to constrain the deformation, and we discuss the potential of the modalities which have been applied to this task. This technology is
on the verge of transition into clinical practice, where it promises to increase the guidance accuracy and facilitate less invasive interventions.

concepts into liver surgery was examined during eight hepatic resection procedures. Preoperative tomographic image data
were acquired and processed. Accompanying intraoperative data on liver shape and position were obtained through
optically tracked probes and laser range scanning technology. The preoperative and intraoperative representations of the
liver surface were aligned using the iterative closest point surface matching algorithm. Surface registrations resulted in mean
residual errors from 2 to 6 mm, with errors of target surface regions being below a stated goal of 1 cm. Issues affecting
registration accuracy include liver motion due to respiration, the quality of the intraoperative surface data, and intraoperative
organ deformation. Respiratory motion was quantified during the procedures as cyclical, primarily along the cranial–caudal
direction. The resulting registrations were more robust and accurate when using laser range scanning to rapidly acquire
thousands of points on the liver surface and when capturing unique geometric regions on the liver surface, such as the
inferior edge. Finally, finite element models recovered much of the observed intraoperative deformation, further decreasing
errors in the registration. Image-guided liver surgery has shown the potential to provide surgeons with important navigation
aids that could increase the accuracy of targeting lesions and the number of patients eligible for surgical resection.},

  Abstract                 = {Image-guided liver surgery requires the ability to
identify and compensate for soft tissue deformation in the organ.
The predeformed state is represented as a complete three-dimensional
surface of the organ, while the intraoperative data is a range
scan point cloud acquired from the exposed liver surface. The first
step is to rigidly align the coordinate systems of the intraoperative
and preoperative data. Most traditional rigid registration methods
minimize an error metric over the entire data set. In this paper, a
new deformation-identifying rigid registration (DIRR) is reported
that identifies and aligns minimally deformed regions of the data
using a modified closest point distance cost function. Once a rigid
alignment has been established, deformation is accounted for using
a linearly elastic finite element model (FEM) and implemented
using an incremental framework to resolve geometric nonlinearities.
Boundary conditions for the incremental formulation are
generated from intraoperatively acquired range scan surfaces
of the exposed liver surface. A series of phantom experiments is
presented to assess the fidelity of the DIRR and the combined
DIRR/FEM approaches separately. The DIRR approach identified
deforming regions in 90% of cases under conditions of realistic
surgical exposure. With respect to the DIRR/FEM algorithm,
subsurface target errors were correctly located to within 4 mm in
phantom experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion
and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical
training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component
of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery,
and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these
procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical
target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms
body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive
needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable
needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm
for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral
mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation
of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D
finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip
friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for
physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively
simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra
and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel
Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with
needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and
supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate
the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world
experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into

  Abstract                 = {We present a new algorithm to register 3-D preoperative
magnetic resonance (MR) images to intraoperativeMRimages
of the brain which have undergone brain shift. This algorithm relies
on a robust estimation of the deformation from a sparse noisy
set of measured displacements. We propose a new framework to
compute the displacement field in an iterative process, allowing
the solution to gradually move from an approximation formulation
(minimizing the sum of a regularization term and a data error
term) to an interpolation formulation (least square minimization
of the data error term). An outlier rejection step is introduced in
this gradual registration process using a weighted least trimmed
squares approach, aiming at improving the robustness of the algorithm.
We use a patient-specific model discretized with the finite
element method in order to ensure a realistic mechanical behavior
of the brain tissue.
To meet the clinical time constraint, we parallelized the slowest
step of the algorithm so that we can perform a full 3-D image registration
in 35 s (including the image update time) on a heterogeneous
cluster of 15 personal computers. The algorithm has been
tested on six cases of brain tumor resection, presenting a brain shift
of up to 14 mm. The results show a good ability to recover large
displacements, and a limited decrease of accuracy near the tumor
resection cavity.},

  Abstract                 = {Similar to the well documented brain shift experienced during neurosurgical procedures, intra-operative soft tissue deformation in open hepatic resections is the primary source of error in current image-guided liver surgery (IGLS) systems. The use of bio-mechanical models has shown promise in providing the link between the deformed, intra-operative patient anatomy and the pre-operative image data. More specifically, the current protocol for deformation compensation in IGLS involves the determination of displacements via registration of intra-operatively acquired sparse data and subsequent use of the displacements to drive solution of a linear elastic model via the finite element method (FEM). However, direct solution of the model during the surgical procedure has several logistical limitations including computational time and the ability to accurately prescribe boundary conditions and material properties. Recently, approaches utilizing an atlas of pre-operatively computed model solutions based on a priori information concerning the surgical loading conditions have been proposed as a more realistic avenue for intra-operative deformation compensation. Similar to previous work, we propose the use of a simple linear inverse model to match the intra-operatively acquired data to the pre-operatively computed atlas. Additionally, an iterative approach is implemented whereby point correspondence is updated during the matching process, being that the correspondence between intra-operative data and the pre-operatively computed atlas is not explicitly known in liver applications. Preliminary validation experiments of the proposed algorithm were performed using both simulation and phantom data. The proposed method provided comparable results in the phantom experiments with those obtained using the traditional incremental FEM approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Compensating for intraoperative brain shift using computational models has shown promising results. Since computational time is an
important factor during neurosurgery, a priori knowledge of the possible sources of deformation can increase the accuracy of modelupdated
image-guided systems. In this paper, a strategy to compensate for distributed loading conditions in the brain such as brain
sag, volume changes due to drug reactions, and brain swelling due to edema is presented. An atlas of model deformations based on these
complex loading conditions is computed preoperatively and used with a constrained linear inverse model to predict the intraoperative
distributed brain shift. This relatively simple inverse finite-element approach is investigated within the context of a series of phantom
experiments, two in vivo cases, and a simulation study. Preliminary results indicate that the approach recaptured on average 93% of surface
shift for the simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. With respect to subsurface shift, comparisons were only made with simulation
and phantom experiments and demonstrated an ability to recapture 85% of the shift. This translates to a remaining surface and
subsurface shift error of 0.7 ± 0.3 mm, and 1.0 ± 0.4 mm, respectively, for deformations on the order of 1 cm.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present the application of a semi-global inverse method for determining material parameters of biological tissues. The approach is based on the successive response surface method, and is illustrated by fitting constitutive parameters to two nonlinear anisotropic constitutive equations, one for aortic sinus and aortic wall, the other for aortic valve tissue. Material test data for the aortic sinus consisted of two independent orthogonal uniaxial tests. Material test data for the aortic valve was obtained from a dynamic inflation test. In each case, a numerical simulation of the experiment was performed and predictions were compared to the real data. For the uniaxial test simulation, the experimental targets were force at a measured displacement. For the inflation test, the experimental targets were the three-dimensional coordinates of material markers at a given pressure. For both sets of tissues, predictions with converged parameters showed excellent agreement with the data, and we found that the method was able to consistently identify model parameters. We believe the method will find wide application in biomedical material characterization and in diagnostic imaging.},

in nonlinear elasticity problems. The stabilization term adapts to the solution of the problem by locally changing the size of a penalty
term on the appearance of discontinuities, with the goal of better approximating the solution. Consequently, it is called an adaptive stabilization
strategy. The need for such a strategy is motivated through two- and three-dimensional examples in nonlinear elasticity. The
proposed scheme is simple to implement and compute, and its performance is demonstrated with two- and three-dimensional numerical
examples. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared against a conforming method of the same order and a DG method with a
traditional form of stabilization. Results for trilinear hexahedral elements indicate that the new stabilization strategy is more robust and
more accurate when compared to a traditional form of stabilization. However, conforming trilinear hexahedral elements proved to be
more computationally efficient for the examples shown here. A two-dimensional},

According to the complexity of the model, different features of soft biological tissue will be incorporated, i.e. nonlinearity, viscoelasticity, anisotropy, heterogeneity and finally, tissue damage during deformation. A brief summary of experimental methods for material characterisation and an introduction to methods for geometric modelling are also provided. The overview is non-exhaustive, focusing on the most important general models and models with specific biological applications. A trade-off in complexity must be made for enabling real-time simulation, but still maintaining realistic representation of the organ deformation. Depending on the organ and tissue types, different models with emphasis on certain features will prove to be more appropriate, meaning the optimal model choice is organ and tissue-dependent.},

  Abstract                 = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics,
and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions
involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers
integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the
interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen
fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the
artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and
very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the
circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation
of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial
tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to
capture accurately the stress–strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper,
therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the
dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new
hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic
elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of
the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel & Gasser (Holzapfel & Gasser
2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379–4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al.
2000 J. Elast. 61, 1–48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter

realistic simulation of objects exhibiting an elastic modulus with a dynamic range of several orders of magnitude.
Using the linearized strain measure, we can simulate 50 thousand tetrahedral elements with 20 fps on a single

space of the blending elements at the edge of the enriched subdomain. A discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
formulation is developed, which circumvents this source of error. A patch-based version of the DG
formulation is developed, which decomposes the domain into enriched and unenriched subdomains.
Continuity between patches is enforced with an internal penalty method. An element-based form is also
developed, where each element is considered a patch. The patch-based DG is shown to have similar
accuracy to the element-based DG for a given discretization but requires significantly fewer degrees
of freedom. The method is applied to material interfaces, cracks and dislocation problems. For the
dislocations, a contour integral form of the internal forces that only requires integration over the patch
boundaries is developed. A previously developed assumed strain (AS) method is also developed further
and compared with the DG method for weak discontinuities and linear elastic cracks. The DG method is
shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard XFEM for a given element size and to converge
optimally, even where the standard XFEM does not. The accuracy of the DG method is similar to that of
the AS method but requires less application-specific coding.},

closely related to the non-conforming Crouzeix–Raviart (CR) element, which in fact is obtained when
one of the stabilizing parameters tends to infinity. In the case of the elasticity operator, for which the CR
element is not stable in that it does not fulfill a discrete Korn’s inequality, the discontinuous framework
naturally suggests the appearance of (weakly consistent) stabilization terms. Thus, a stabilized version
of the CR element, which does not lock, can be used for both compressible and (nearly) incompressible
elasticity. Numerical results supporting these assertions are},

  Abstract                 = {Image-based modeling of cardiovascular biomechanics may be very helpful for patients with aortic aneurysms to predict the risk of rupture and evaluate the necessity of a surgical intervention. In order to generate a reliable support it is necessary to develop exact patient-specific models that simulate biomechanical parameters and provide individual structural analysis of the state of fatigue and characterize this to the potential of rupture of the aortic wall. The patient-specific geometry used here originates from a CT scan of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). The computations are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and simulate the wall stress distribution and the vessel deformation. The wall transient boundary conditions are based on real time-dependent pressure simulations obtained from a previous computational fluid dynamics study. The physiological wall material properties consider a nonlinear hyperelastic constitutive model, based on realistic ex-vivo analysis of the aneurismal arterial tissue. The results showed complex deformation and stress distribution on the AAA wall. The maximum stresses occurred at the systole and are found around the aneurismal bulge in regions close to inflection points. Biomechanical modeling based on medical images and coupled with patient-specific hemodynamics allows analysing and quantifying the effects of dilatation of the arterial wall due to the pulsatile aortic pressure. It provides a physical and realistic insight into the wall mechanics and enables predictive simulations of AAA growth and assessment of rupture. Further development integrating endovascular models would help evaluating non-invasively individual treatment strategies for optimal placement and improved device design.},

Image-based computational modeling provides a physical and realistic insight into the patient-specific biomechanics and enables accurate predictive simulations of development, growth and failure of cardiovascular disease. An experimental validation is necessary for the evaluation and the clinical implementation of such computational models. In the present study, we have implemented dynamic Computed-Tomography (4D-CT) imaging and catheter-based in vivo measured pressures to numerically simulate and experimentally evaluate the biomechanics of the porcine aorta. The computations are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and simulate the arterial wall response to the transient pressure-based boundary condition. They are evaluated by comparing the numerically predicted wall deformation and that calculated from the acquired 4D-CT data. The dynamic motion of the vessel is quantified by means of the hydraulic diameter, analyzing sequences at 5% increments over the cardiac cycle. Our results show that accurate biomechanical modeling is possible using FEM-based simulations. The RMS error of the computed hydraulic diameter at five cross-sections of the aorta was 0.188, 0.252, 0.280, 0.237 and 0.204 mm, which is equivalent to 1.7%, 2.3%, 2.7%, 2.3% and 2.0%, respectively, when expressed as a function of the time-averaged hydraulic diameter measured from the CT images. The present investigation is a first attempt to simulate and validate vessel deformation based on realistic morphological data and boundary conditions. An experimentally validated system would help in evaluating individual therapies and optimal treatment strategies in the field of minimally invasive endovascular surgery.},

Cardiovascular diseases result from complex flow pattern and fatigue of the vessel wall and are prevalent causes leading to high mortality each year. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Computational Structure Mechanics (CSM) and Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) have become efficient tools in modeling the individual hemodynamics and biomechanics as well as their interaction in the human arteries. The computations allow non-invasively simulating patient-specific physical parameters of the blood flow and the vessel wall needed for an efficient minimally invasive treatment. The numerical simulations are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and require exact and individual mesh models to be provided. In the present study, we developed a numerical tool to automatically generate complex patient-specific Finite Element (FE) mesh models from image-based geometries of healthy and diseased vessels. The mesh generation is optimized based on the integration of mesh control functions for curvature, boundary layers and mesh distribution inside the computational domain. The needed mesh parameters are acquired from a computational grid analysis which ensures mesh-independent and stable simulations. Further, the generated models include appropriate FE sets necessary for the definition of individual boundary conditions, required to solve the system of nonlinear partial differential equations governed by the fluid and solid domains. Based on the results, we have performed computational blood flow and vessel wall simulations in patient-specific aortic models providing a physical insight into the pathological vessel parameters. Automatic mesh generation with individual awareness in terms of geometry and conditions is a prerequisite for performing fast, accurate and realistic FEM-based computations of hemodynamics and biomechanics in the arteries and is therefore included in this work. The tool is integrated into our simulation system for CFD, CSM and FSI applications and represents an essential aspect for efficient and fast evaluation of surgical procedures based on predictive simulations of disease growth, state of fatigue and assessment of risk individually for each patient.},

The simulation results show realistic mean WSS distributions and provide a quantitative description of the stress conditions in the aortic model. The mean range of the computed values is compatible with that obtained by other in vivo and in vitro methods [1], [2]. The method provides a numerical approach for the computation of WSS.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a viscoelastic model for the fully three-dimensional stress and deformation response of fiber-reinforced composites that experience finite strains. The composites are thought to be (soft) matrix materials which are reinforced by two families of fibers so that the mechanical properties of the composites depend on two fiber directions. The relaxation and/or creep response of each compound of the composite is modeled separately and the global response is obtained by an assembly of all contributions. We develop novel closed-form expressions for the fourth-order elasticity tensor (tangent moduli) in full generality. Constitutive models for orthotropic, transversely isotropic and isotropic hyperelastic materials at finite strains with or without dissipation are included as special cases. In order to clearly show the good performance of the constitutive model, we present 3D and 2D numerical simulations of a pressurized laminated circular tube which shows an interesting ‘stretch inversion phenomenon' in the low pressure domain. Numerical results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data and approximate the observed strongly anisotropic physical response with satisfying accuracy. A third numerical example is designed to illustrate the anisotropic stretching process of a fiber-reinforced rubber bar and the subsequent relaxation behavior at finite strains. The material parameters are chosen so that thermodynamic equilibrium is associated with the known homogeneous deformation state.},

important for radiotherapy since it can allow to reduce the healthy tissue
irradiation. Moreover, guiding system for punctures in interventional
radiology would reduce significantly their guidance inaccuracy. In a first
part, we analyse physically the breathing motion and show that it is possible
to predict internal organ motions from the abdominal skin position.
Then, we propose an original method to compute from the skin position
a deformation field to the internal organs that takes mechanical properties
of the breathing into account. Finally, we show on human data that
our simulation model can provide a prediction of several organ positions
(liver, kidneys, lungs) at 14 Hz with an accuracy within 7 mm.},

  Abstract                 = {Real time computation of soft tissue deformation is important for the use of augmented reality devices and for providing haptic feedback during operation or surgeon training. This requires algorithms that are fast, accurate and can handle material nonlinearities and large deformations. A set of such algorithms is presented in this paper, starting with the finite element formulation and the integration scheme used and addressing common problems such as hourglass control and locking. The computation examples presented prove that by using these algorithms, real time computations become possible without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. For a brain model having more than 7000 degrees of freedom, we computed the reaction forces due to indentation with frequency of around 1000 Hz using a standard dual core PC. Similarly, we conducted simulation of brain shift using a model with more than 50,000 degrees of freedom in less than one minute. The speed benefits of our models result from combining the Total Lagrangian formulation with explicit time integration and low order finite elements.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we present an inverse finite-element modeling framework for constitutive modeling and parameter estimation of soft tissues using full-field volumetric deformation data obtained from 3D ultrasound. The finite-element model is coupled to full-field visual measurements by regularization springs attached at nodal locations. The free ends of the springs are displaced according to the locally estimated tissue motion, and the normalized potential energy stored in all springs serves as a measure of model-experiment agreement for material parameter optimization. We demonstrate good accuracy of estimated parameters and consistent convergence properties on synthetically generated data. We present constitutive model selection and parameter estimation for perfused porcine liver in indentation, and demonstrate that a quasilinear viscoelastic model with shear modulus relaxation offers good model-experiment agreement in terms of indenter displacement (0.19 mm RMS error) and tissue displacement field (0.97 mm RMS error).},

  Abstract                 = {We have extended a new highly accurate numerical scheme for
unstructured 2D and 3D meshes based on the discontinuous
Galerkin approach to simulate seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous
media containing fluid-solid interfaces. Because of
the formulation of the wave equations as a unified first-order hyperbolic
system in velocity stress, the fluid can be in movement
along the interface. The governing equations within the moving
fluid are derived from well-known first principles in fluid mechanics.
The discontinuous Galerkin approach allows for jumps
of the material parameters and the solution across element interfaces,
which are handled by Riemann solvers or numerical fluxes.
The use of Riemann solvers at the element interfaces makesthe
treatment of the fluid particularly simple bysetting the shear
modulus in the fluid region to zero. No additional compatibility
relations, such as vanishing shear stress or continuity of normal
stresses, are necessary to couple the solid and fluid along an interface.
The Riemann solver automatically recognizes the jump of
the material coefficients at the interface and provides the correct
numerical fluxes for fluid-solid contacts. Therefore, wave propagation
in the entire computational domain containing heterogeneous
media, namely moving fluids and elastic solids, can be described
by a uniform set of acoustic and elastic wave equations.
The accuracy of the proposed scheme is confirmed by comparing
numerical results against analytic solutions. The potential of the
new method was demonstrated in a 3Dmodel problem typical for
marine seismic exploration with a fluid-solid interface determined
by a complicated bathymetry.},

Instead of refining or remeshing the underlying simulation domain to resolve complex cut paths, we adapt the extended finite element method (XFEM) and enrich our approximation by customdesigned basis functions, while keeping the simulation mesh unchanged. The enrichment functions are stored in enrichment textures, which allows for fracture and cutting discontinuities at a resolution much finer than the underlying mesh, similar to image textures for increased visual resolution. Furthermore, we propose harmonic enrichment functions to handle multiple, intersecting, arbitrarily shaped, progressive cuts per element in a simple and unified framework. Our underlying shell simulation is based on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) FEM, which relaxes the restrictive requirement of C1 continuous basis functions and thus allows for simpler, C0 continuous XFEM enrichment functions.},

In contrast to traditional FEM, it overcomes the restrictions of conforming basis functions by allowing for discontinuous elements with weakly enforced continuity constraints. This added flexibility enables the simulation of arbitrarily shaped, convex and non-convex polyhedral elements, while still using simple polynomial basis functions. For the accurate strain integration over these elements we propose an analytic technique based on the divergence theorem. Being able to handle arbitrary elements eventually allows us to derive simple and efficient techniques for volumetric mesh generation, adaptive mesh refinement, and robust cutting. Furthermore, we show DG FEM not to suffer from locking artifacts even for nearly incompressible materials, a problem that in standard FEM requires special handling.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate characterization of soft tissue material properties is required to enable new computer-aided medical technologies such as surgical training and planning. The current means of acquiring these properties in the in vivo and ex vivo states is fraught with problems, including limited accessibility and unknown boundary conditions in the former, and unnatural behavior in the latter. This paper presents a new testing method where a whole porcine liver is perfused under physiologic conditions and tested in an ex vivo setting. To characterize the effects of perfusion on the viscoelastic response of liver, indentation devices made force and displacement measurements across four conditions: in vivo, ex vivo perfused, ex vivo post perfused, and in vitro on an excised section. One device imposed cyclic perturbations on the liver's surface, inducing nominal strains up to 5% at frequencies from 0.1 to 200 Hz. The other device measured 300 s of the organ's creep response to applied loads, inducing nominal surface stresses of 6.9–34.7 kPa and nominal strains up to 50%. Results from empirical models indicate that the viscoelastic properties of liver change with perfusion and that two time constants on the order of 1.86 and 51.3 s can characterize the liver under large strains typical of surgical manipulation across time periods up to 300 s. Unperfused conditions were stiffer and more viscous than the in vivo state, resulting in permanent strain deformation with repeated indentations. Conversely, the responses from the ex vivo perfusion condition closely approximated the in vivo response.},

  Abstract                 = {Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the numerical solution of partial
dierential equations have enjoyed considerable success because they are both

exible and robust: They allow arbitrary unstructured geometries and easy
control of accuracy without compromising simulation stability. Lately, another
property of DG has been growing in importance: The majority of a DG operator
is applied in an element-local way, with weak penalty-based element-to-element
coupling.
The resulting locality in memory access is one of the factors that enables
DG to run on o-the-shelf, massively parallel graphics processors (GPUs). In
addition, DG's high-order nature lets it require fewer data points per represented
wavelength and hence fewer memory accesses, in exchange for higher
arithmetic intensity. Both of these factors work signicantly in favor of a GPU
implementation of DG.
Using a single US$400 Nvidia GTX 280 GPU, we accelerate a solver for
Maxwell's equations on a general 3D unstructured grid by a factor of 40 to 60
relative to a serial computation on a current-generation CPU. In many cases,
our algorithms exhibit full use of the device's available memory bandwidth.
Example computations achieve and surpass 200 giga
ops/s of net applicationlevel

oating point work.
In this article, we describe and derive the techniques used to reach this level
of performance. In addition, we present comprehensive data on the accuracy
and runtime behavior of the method.

  Abstract                 = {The point collocation-based method of finite spheres (PCMFS) was introduced as a meshfree technique for real time simulation of
surgical processes. While real time graphical rendering requires an update rate of about 30 Hz, a much higher update rate of 1 kHz is
necessary for smooth haptic (touch) feedback. The requirement of real time performance is crucial to these simulations and is highly
demanding in terms of computational efficiency. In this paper we extend the PCMFS technique to tissue deformations that are geometrically
nonlinear. The technique is based on a novel combination of multiresolution approach coupled with a fast reanalysis scheme in
which the response predicted by an underlying linear PCMFS model is enhanced in the local neighborhood of the surgical tool-tip by a
nonlinear model. We present performance comparisons of PCMFS with traditional finite element models.},

fully exploited. The robustness and accuracy of each DG method are demonstrated and compared with
mixed methods through solving a rubber beam problem. The coupled use of DG with continuous elements
is proposed for some practical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Physically based simulation is a significant and active research field in computer graphics.
It has emerged in the late eighties out of the need to make animations more physically plausible
and to free the animator from explicitly specifying the motion of complex passively
moving objects. In the early days, quite simple approaches were used to model physical
behavior such as mass-spring networks or particle systems. Later, more and more sophisticated
models borrowed from computational sciences were adopted. The computational
sciences appeared decades before computer graphics with the goal of replacing real world
experiments with simulations on computers. In contrast, the aim of using physical simulations
in graphics was, and still is, the reproduction of the visual properties of physical
processes for special effects in commercials and movies. Computer generated special effects
have replaced earlier methods such as stop-motion frame-by-frame animation and offer
almost unlimited possibilities.
Meanwhile, the rapid growth of the computational power of CPUs and GPUs in recent
years has enabled real time simulation of physical effects. This possibility has opened
the door to an entirely new world, a world in which the user can interact with the virtual
physical environment. Real time physical simulations have become one of the main nextgeneration
features of computer games. Allowing user interaction with physical simulations
also poses new challenging research problems. In this class we address such problems and
present basic as well as state-of-the-art methods for physically based simulation in real time.},

current objectives of computer graphics. One of its fields of application lies in virtual
reality, mainly in surgery simulation systems. In computer graphics, the models used
for the construction of objects with deformable behaviour are known as deformable
models. These have two conflicting characteristics: interactivity and motion realism.
The different deformable models developed to date have promoted only one of these
(usually interactivity) to the detriment of the other (biomechanical realism). In this
paper, we present a classification of the different deformable models that have been
developed. We present the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Finally, we
make a comparison of deformable models and perform an evaluation of the state of
the art and the future of deformable models.},

The basis of our method is formed by a fast and accurate finite element implementation of

Using quadratic shape functions, we reduce approximation errors inherent to methods
based on linear finite elements. The physical simulation uses a volume mesh comprised of
quadratic tetrahedra, which are constructed from a coarser approximation of the detailed
surface. In order to guarantee stability and real-time frame rates during the simulation,
we cast the elasto-plastic problem into a linear formulation. For this purpose, we present
a corotational formulation for quadratic finite elements. We demonstrate the versatility of
our approach in interactive manipulation sessions and show that our animation system can
be coupled with further physics-based animations, like fluids and cloth, in a bi-directional

  Abstract                 = {Mechanical properties of very soft tissues, such as brain, liver, kidney and prostate have recently joined the mainstream research topics in biomechanics. This has happened in spite of the fact that these tissues do not bear mechanical loads. The interest in the biomechanics of very soft tissues has been motivated by the developments in computer-integrated and robot-aided surgery—in particular, the emergence of automatic surgical tools and robots—as well as advances in virtual reality techniques. Mechanical testing of very soft tissues provides a formidable challenge for an experimenter. Very soft tissues are usually tested in compression using an unconfined compression set-up, which requires ascertaining that friction between sample faces and stress–strain machine platens is close to zero. In this paper a more reliable method of testing is proposed. In the proposed method top and bottom faces of a cylindrical specimen with low aspect ratio are rigidly attached to the platens of the stress–strain machine (e.g. using surgical glue). This arrangement allows using a no-slip boundary condition in the analysis of the results. Even though the state of deformation in the sample cannot be treated as orthogonal the relationships between total change of height (measured) and strain are obtained. Two important results are derived: (i) deformed shape of a cylindrical sample subjected to uniaxial compression is independent on the form of constitutive law, (ii) vertical extension in the plane of symmetry ?z is proportional to the total change of height for strains as large as 30%. The importance and relevance of these results to testing procedures in biomechanics are highlighted.},

In order to protect them properly against car crash and other impact consequences, we need to be able to simulate the abdominal organ deformation. Such simulation should account for proper stress–strain relation as well as stress dependence on strain rate. As the step in this direction, this paper presents three-dimensional, non-linear, viscoelastic constitutive models for liver and kidney tissue. The models have been constructed basing on in vivo experiments conducted in Highway Safety Research Institute and the Medical Centre of The University of Michigan (Melvin et al., 1973). The proposed models are valid for compressive nominal strains up to 35% and fast (impact) strain rates between 0.2 and 22.5 s1. Similar models can find applications in computer and robot assisted surgery, e.g. the realistic simulation of surgical procedures (including virtual reality) and non-rigid registration.},

The ultimate goal of our research into the biomechanics of these tissues is the development of corresponding, realistic mathematical models. This paper contains experimental results of in vitro, uniaxial, unconfined compression of swine brain tissue and discusses a single-phase, non-linear, viscoelastic tissue model. The experimental results obtained for three loading velocities, ranging over five orders of magnitude, are presented. The applied strain rates have been much lower than those applied in previous studies, focused on injury modelling. The stress-strain curves are concave upward for all compression rates containing no linear portion from which a meaningful elastic modulus might be determined. The tissue response stiffened as the loading speed increased, indicating a strong stress-strain rate dependence. The use of the single-phase model is recommended for applications in registration, surgical operation planning and training systems as well as a control system of an image-guided surgical robot. The material constants for the brain tissue are evaluated. Agreement between the proposed theoretical model and experiment is good for compression levels reaching 30% and for loading velocities varying over five orders of magnitude.},

for human organs are required for medical applications such as surgery
simulation, surgery planning, diagnosis. In the literature the mechanical
properties of biosolids are generally presented in “preconditioned” state,
i.e. the stabilized conditions reached after several loading-unloading cycles.
We hereby present experiments on soft tissues showing the evolution
of the mechanical response in a series of loading and unloading cycles.
The experimental procedure applied in this study is based on the so
called “aspiration experiment” and is suitable for in-vivo applications
under sterile conditions during open surgery. In the present study this
technique is applied ex-vivo on bovine liver. A small tube is contacted
to the target organ and a weak vacuum is generated inside the tube according
to a predefined pressure history. Several identical loading and
unloading cycles are applied in order to characterize the evolutive behaviour
of the tissue. The experimental data are used to inform the
fitting of uniaxial and threedimensional continuum mechanics models.
This analysis demonstrates that a quasi-linear viscoelastic model fails
in describing the observed evolution from the “virgin” to the preconditioned
state. Good agreement between simulation and measurement are
obtained by introducing an internal variable changing according to an
evolution equation.},

  Abstract                 = {Finite element methods are commonly used in the graphics and virtual
reality communities for simulating the behavior of deformable
objects. For simplicity and low computational cost, practitioners
often use a small-deformation linear elastic model in conjunction
with tetrahedral elements, with a “stiffness warping” method sometimes
employed to correct the distortions which can arise from large
deformations. In this paper, we show how stiffness warping can
be easily extended to more complex nonlinear elements, particularly
hexahedra and quadratic tetrahedra. This involves identifying
a “characteristic tetrahedron” within the element and using that to
determine the warping transformation. We then show that nonlinear
elements can provide advantages in both fidelity and/or computational
speed (several fold for high accuracy models) as compared
with linear tetrahedra.},

involving complex material response, e.g. non-local behavior and failure, as, even in the presence of
discontinuities, they provide a rigorous means of ensuring both consistency and stability. In the proposed
method, these are guaranteed: the former by the use of average numerical fluxes and the latter by the
introduction of appropriate quadratic terms in the weak formulation. The semi-discrete system of ordinary
differential equations is integrated in time using a conventional second-order central-difference explicit
scheme. A stability criterion for the time integration algorithm, accounting for the influence of the DG
discretization stability, is derived for the equivalent linearized system. This approach naturally lends itself
to efficient parallel implementation. The resulting DG computational framework is implemented in three
dimensions via specialized interface elements. The versatility, robustness and scalability of the overall
computational approach are all demonstrated in problems involving stress-wave propagation and large
plastic deformations.},

a weak statement of the governing differential equations via a

consistency and stability of the formulation, this approach requires
the definition of a numerical flux and a stabilization term.
Discontinuous Galerkin methods may also be formulated from a
linear combination of the governing and compatibility equations
weighted by suitable operators. A third approach based on a
variational statement of a generalized energy functional has been
proposed recently for finite elasticity. This alternative approach
naturally leads to an expression of the numerical flux and the
stabilization terms in the context of large deformation mechanics
problems. This paper compares these three approaches and establishes
the conditions under which identical formulations are
obtained.},

further developments involving behaviour or models where the DG concept can show its superiority

this approach naturally leads to the formulation of average stress fluxes at interelement boundaries

Rd×d. The associated energy functional is then uniformly convex. An optimal
order bound is derived on the discretization error in each case without requiring
the global Lipschitz continuity of the tensor S. We then further relax our hypotheses:
using a broken G°arding inequality we extend our optimal error bounds to the
case of quasilinear hyperbolic systems where, instead of assuming that S is uniformly
monotone, we only require that the fourth-order tensor is satisfies
a Legendre–Hadamard condition. The associated energy functional is then only
rank-1 convex. Evolution problems of this kind arise as mathematical models in
nonlinear elastic wave propagation.},

the basis functions used for interpolating position and pressure, and the type of element
making up the mesh. The effect of these choices on the accuracy of the computed solution is
investigated, using a selection of model problems motivated by typical deformations seen in
soft tissue modelling. Model problems are set up with discontinuous material properties (as is
the case for the breast), steeply changing gradients in the body force (as found in contracting
cardiac tissue), and discontinuous first derivatives in the solution at the boundary, caused by a
discontinuous applied force (as in the breast during mammography). It was found that the
choice of pressure basis functions is vital in the presence of a material interface, higher-order
schemes do not perform as well as may be expected when there are sharp gradients, and in
general it is important to take the expected regularity of the solution into account when
choosing a numerical scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {Contemporary imaging modalities can now provide the surgeon with high
quality three- and four-dimensional images depicting not only normal anatomy
and pathology, but also vascularity and function. A key component of imageguided
surgery (IGS) is the ability to register multi-modal pre-operative images
to each other and to the patient. The other important component of IGS
is the ability to track instruments in real time during the procedure and to
display them as part of a realistic model of the operative volume. Stereoscopic,
virtual- and augmented-reality techniques have been implemented to enhance
the visualization and guidance process. For the most part, IGS relies on
the assumption that the pre-operatively acquired images used to guide the
surgery accurately represent themorphology of the tissue during the procedure.
This assumption may not necessarily be valid, and so intra-operative real-time
imaging using interventional MRI, ultrasound, video and electrophysiological
recordings are often employed to ameliorate this situation. Although IGS is
now in extensive routine clinical use in neurosurgery and is gaining ground in
other surgical disciplines, there remainmany drawbacks that must be overcome
before it can be employed in more general minimally-invasive procedures.
This review overviews the roots of IGS in neurosurgery, provides examples of
its use outside the brain, discusses the infrastructure required for successful
implementation of IGS approaches and outlines the challenges that must be
overcome for IGS to advance further.},

that it is invariant with respect to rotations. This
property improves the realism of the deformations and
solves the problems related to the shortcomings of linear
elasticity, which is only valid for small displacements.
We also address the problem of anisotropic behavior,

constraints. Finaily, we demonstrate the

  Abstract                 = {Segmental liver resection and locoregional ablative therapies are dependent upon accurate tumor localization to ensure safety as well as acceptable oncologic results. Because of the liver’s limited external landmarks and complex internal anatomy, such tumor localization poses a technical challenge. Image guided therapies (IGT) address this problem by mapping the real-time, intraoperative position of surgical instruments onto preoperative tomographic imaging through a process called registration. Accuracy is critical to IGT and is a function of: 1) the registration technique, 2) the tissue characteristics, and 3) imaging techniques. The purpose of this study is to validate a novel method of registration using an endoscopic Laser Range Scanner (eLRS) and demonstrate its applicability to laparoscopic liver surgery. Six radiopaque targets were inserted into an ex-vivo bovine liver and a computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained. Using the eLRS, the liver surface was scanned and a surface-based registration was constructed to predict the position of the intraparenchymal targets. The target registration error (TRE) achieved using our surface-based registration was 2.4 ± 1.0 mm. A comparable TRE using traditional fiducial-based registration was 2.6 ± 1.7 mm. Compared to traditional fiducial-based registration, laparoscopic surface scanning is able to predict the location of intraparenchymal liver targets with similar accuracy and rate of data acquisition.},

To compute the deformation of composite materials correctly borders between adjacent tissues must be preserved. In this paper a new meshing algorithm is presented that fulfill this requirement. Additionally it works automatically in a straight forward manner to produce high quality 3d meshes from input triangle surfaces. The algorithm shows robust behavior and allows even to generate mesh from the most complex geometries. The processing time depends directly on the size of the input mesh and not on topology. This makes this algorithm calculable hence useful for time dependant cases, for example to adapt intraoperatively to modified operation status.},

  Abstract                 = {Surgical intervention at the cervical spine is one of the most difficult interventions in surgery. Special care must be taken to the sensitive anatomy around, e.g., the trachea, oesophagus, arteries and spinal nerves. This paper presents a novel approach in neurosurgical navigation which takes into account these structures in the cervical region by calculating continuously the soft tissue's deformation during the neurological intervention. We use a fast finite element model (FFEM) for the functional modelling of the cervical spine and a graphical deformation algorithm for the surrounding.},

Damit könnte für den Patienten eine Reduktion des Operationstraumas und eine optimierte postoperative Mobilität erreicht werden. Die Basis einer solchen Simulation ist ein Finite-Elemente-Modell, welches die geometrischen und biomechanischen Eigenschaften der Halswirbelsäule des Patienten exakt wiedergibt. Bisher fehlt es jedoch an einem durchgängigen Prozess zum Aufbau eines solchen Modells ausgehend von den tomografischen Bilddaten.

  Abstract                 = {soft tissue is a prerequisite for surgery planning and surgery training. Realism of soft tissue deformations depends extremely on the selection of adequate material models for the pertinent tissue or organ which should be modelled. Every kind of human tissue requires its own explicitly adapted biomechanical modelling. Finding an appropriate material law for a given object/material combination is one of the most diffcult tasks in biomechanical modelling. Furthermore it is not easy to compare the mathematical models with each other because they are described independently and rarely use the same mathematical formulation. A lot of work in the field of soft tissue modelling is done without checking for that. In this paper we present results of a mathematical comparison of three famous material models for soft tissue modeling, compare them with relevant literature values and give some advice depending on the simulation's peculiarity for an appropriate selection. We focus in this paper on passive modelling of skeletal muscles as it will be necessary for soft tissue modelling of anesthetized patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer-aided surgical simulation is a topic of increasingly extensive
research. Computer graphics, geometric modeling and finiteelement
analysis all play major roles in these simulations. Furthermore,
real-time response, interactivity and accuracy are crucial
components in any such simulation system. A major effort has been
invested in recent years to find ways to improve the performance,
accuracy and realism of existing systems.
In this paper, we extend the work of [Sela et al. 2004], in which we
used Discontinuous Free Form Deformations (DFFD) to artificially
simulate real-time surgical operations. The presented scheme now
uses accurate data from a Finite-Element Model (FEM), which simulates
the motion response of the tissue around the scalpel, during
incision. The data is then encoded once into the DFFD, representing
the simulation over time. In real-time, The DFFD is applied
to the vertices of the surface mesh at the actual incision location
and time. The presented scheme encapsulates and takes advantage
of both the speed of the DFFD application, and the accuracy of a
FEM. In addition, the presented system uses a haptic force feedback
device in order to improve realism and ease of use.},

  Abstract                 = {Encouraged by the success of spectral elements methods in computational fluid dynamics and p-type finite element
methods in st~ctural mechanics we wish to extend these ideas to solving high order polynomial approximations on
triangular domains as the next generation of spectral element solvers. We introduce here a complete formulation using a
modal basis which has been implemented in a new code n/edar. The new basis has the following properties: Jacobi
polynomials of mixed weights; semi-orthogonal@; hierarchical structure; generalized tensor (warped) product; variable
order; and a new apex co-ordinate system allowing automated integration with Gaussian quadrature. We have discussed the
formulation using a matrix notation which allows for an easy interpretation of the forward and backward transformations. We
use this notation to formulate the linear advection and Helmholtz equations in an efficient manner and show that we recover
the following properties: well conditioned matrices; asymptotic operation count of 0( N3); scaling 0( N*) of the spectral
radius of the weak convective operator; and exponential convergence using polynomials up to N 40. Having constructed
and numerically analysed these equations we are then able to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a
high-order splitting scheme. We demonstrate a variety of results showing exponential convergence using both deformed and
straight triangular subdomains for both the Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems.},

However, these systems are subject to inaccuracy caused by intraopera-
tive brain movement (brain shift) since commercial systems in use today
typically assume that the intracranial structures are rigid. Experiments
show brain shifts up to several millimeters, making it the cause of the
dominant error in the system. We propose an image-based brain shift
compensation system based on an intraoperatively guided deformable
model. We have recorded a set of brain surface points during the surgery
and used them to guide and/or validate the model predictions. Initial
results show that this system limits the error between its brain surface
prediction and real brain surfaces to within 0.5 mm, which is a signif-
icant improvement over the systems that are based on the rigid brain
assumption, that in this case would have an error of 3 mm or greater.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimally invasive surgery is a highly complex medical discipline with various risks for surgeon and patient, but has also numerous advantages on patient-side. The surgeon has to adapt special operation-techniques and deal with difficulties like the complex hand-eye coordination, limited field of view and restricted mobility. To alleviate with these new problems, we propose to support the surgeon's spatial cognition by using augmented reality (AR) techniques to directly visualize virtual objects in the surgical site. In order to generate an intelligent support, it is necessary to have an intraoperative assistance system that recognizes the surgical skills during the intervention and provides context-aware assistance surgeon using AR techniques. With MEDIASSIST we bundle our research activities in the field of intraoperative intelligent support and visualization. Our experimental setup consists of a stereo endoscope, an optical tracking system and a head-mounted-display for 3D visualization. The framework will be used as platform for the development and evaluation of our research in the field of skill recognition and context-aware assistance generation. This includes methods for surgical skill analysis, skill classification, context interpretation as well as assistive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present the objectives of MEDIASSIST and first results in the fields of skill analysis, visualization and multi-modal interaction. In detail we present a markerless instrument tracking for surgical skill analysis as well as visualization techniques and recognition of interaction gestures in an AR environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical simulations of the anisotropic
mechanical properties of soft tissues and tissue-derived
biomaterials using accurate constitutive models remain
an important and challenging research area in biomechanics.
While most constitutive modeling efforts have
focused on the characterization of experimental data,
only limited studies are available on the feasibility of
utilizing those models in complex computational applications.
An example is the widely utilized exponential
constitutive model proposed by Fung. Although present
in the biomechanics literature for several decades,
implementation of this model into finite element (FE)
simulations has been limited. A major reason for limited
numerical implementations are problems associated with
inherent numerical instability and convergence. To address
this issue, we developed and applied two restrictions
for a generalized Fung-elastic constitutive model
necessary to achieve numerical stability. These are (1)
convexity of the strain energy function, and (2) the
condition number of material stiffness matrix set lower
than a prescribed value. These constraints were implemented
in the nonlinear regression used for constitutive
model parameter estimation to the experimental biaxial
mechanical data. We then implemented the generalized
Fung-elastic model into a commercial FE code (ABAQUS,
Pawtucket, RI, USA). Single element and multielement
planar biaxial test simulations were conducted
to verify the accuracy and robustness of the implementation.
Results indicated that numerical convergence
and accurate FE implementation were consistently obtained.
The present study thus presents an integrated
framework for accurate and robust implementation of
pseudo-elastic constitutive models for planar soft tissues.
Moreover, since our approach is formulated within
a general FE code, it can be straightforwardly adopted
across multiple software platforms.},

with finite element analysis, has become common in many
areas of medical image analysis and surgical simulation. Clinical
employment of such techniques is hindered by conflicting requirements
for high fidelity in the modelling approach, and fast solution
speeds. We report the development of techniques for high-speed
nonlinear finite element analysis for surgical simulation. We use
a fully nonlinear total Lagrangian explicit finite element formulation
which offers significant computational advantages for soft
tissue simulation. However, the key contribution of the work is
the presentation of a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) solution
scheme for the finite element equations. To the best of our knowledge,
this represents the first GPU implementation of a nonlinear
finite element solver. We show that the present explicit finite element
scheme is well suited to solution via highly parallel graphics
hardware, and that even a midrange GPU allows significant solution
speed gains (up to 16 8 ) compared with equivalent CPU implementations.
For the models tested the scheme allows real-time
solution of models with up to 16 000 tetrahedral elements. The use
of GPUs for such purposes offers a cost-effective high-performance
alternative to expensive multi-CPU machines, and may have important
applications in medical image analysis and surgical simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the formulation and a partial analysis of a class of discontinuous Galerkin
methods for quasistatic nonlinear elasticity problems. These methods are endowed with several salient
features. The equations that define the numerical scheme are the Euler–Lagrange equations of a one–
field variational principle, a trait that provides an elegant and simple derivation of the method. In
consonance with general discontinuous Galerkin formulations, it is possible within this framework
to choose different numerical fluxes. Numerical evidence suggests the absence of locking at near
incompressible conditions in the finite deformations regime when piecewise linear elements are adopted.
Finally, a conceivable surprising characteristic is that, as demonstrated with numerical examples, these
methods provide a given accuracy level for a comparable, and often lower, computational cost than
conforming formulations.
Stabilization is occasionally needed for discontinuous Galerkin methods in linear elliptic problems.
In this paper we propose a sufficient condition for the stability of each linearized nonlinear elastic
problem that naturally includes material and geometric parameters; the latter needed to account for
buckling. We then prove that when a similar condition is satisfied by the discrete problem, the method
provides stable linearized deformed configurations upon the addition of a standard stabilization term.
We conclude by discussing the complexity of the implementation, and propose a computationally
efficient approach that avoids looping over both elements and element faces. Several numerical
examples are then presented in two and three dimensions that illustrate the performance of a selected
discontinuous Galerkin method within the class.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers an approach to improving outcomes for neurosurgery patients by enhancing intraoperative navigation and guidance. Currently, intraoperative navigation systems do not accurately account for brain shift or tissue resection. We describe how preoperative images can be incrementally updated to take into account any type of brain tissue deformation that may occur during surgery, and thus to improve the accuracy of image-guided navigation systems. For this purpose, we have developed a non-rigid image registration technique using a biomechanical model, which deforms based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). While the FEM has been used successfully for dealing with deformations such as brain shift, it has difficulty with tissue discontinuities. Here, we describe a novel application of the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) in the field of image-guided surgery in order to model brain deformations that imply tissue discontinuities. In particular, this paper presents a detailed account of the use of XFEM for dealing with retraction and successive resections, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by considering 2D examples based on intraoperative MR images. To evaluate our results, we compute the modified Hausdorff distance between Canny edges extracted from images before and after registration. We show that this distance decreases after registration, and thus demonstrate that our approach improves alignment of intraoperative images.}

We show that XFEM has the potential for being the technique of choice
for modelling tissue retraction and resection during surgery. Candidates
applications are surgical simulators and image-guided surgery. A key
feature of XFEM is that material discontinuities through FEM meshes
can be handled without mesh adaptation or remeshing, as would be required
in regular FEM. As a preliminary illustration, we show the result
of XFEM calculation for a simple 2D shape in which a linear cut was

and material nonlinearities) patient specific finite element brain model was
applied to predict deformation field within the brain during the craniotomyinduced
brain shift. Deformation of brain surface was used as displacement
boundary conditions. Application of the computed deformation field to align
(i.e. register) the preoperative images with the intraoperative ones indicated that
the model very accurately predicts the displacements of gravity centers of the
lateral ventricles and tumor even for very limited information about the brain
surface deformation. These results are sufficient to suggest that nonlinear biomechanical
models can be regarded as one possible way of complementing
medical image processing techniques when conducting nonrigid registration.
Important advantage of such models over the linear ones is that they do not require
unrealistic assumptions that brain deformations are infinitesimally small
and brain tissue stress–strain relationship is linear.},

Existing techniques of deformable modeling for real time simulation have either used approximate methods
that are not physically accurate or linear methods that do not produce reasonable global behavior. Nonlinear finite
element methods (FEM) are globally accurate, but conventional FEM is not real time. In this paper, we apply
nonlinear FEM using mass lumping to produce a diagonal mass matrix that allows real time computation. Adaptive
meshing is necessary to provide sufficient detail where required while minimizing unnecessary computation.
We propose a scheme for mesh adaptation based on an extension of the progressive mesh concept, which we call
dynamic progressive meshes.},
